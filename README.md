# What is IdentityGuard?
IdentityGuard is a collection of Identity and Access Management tools used to manage 1...many Azure Active Directory Tenants at scale.

# Features
## Enhanced Access Reviews
Perform in-depth access reviews on users, applications, groups, and other identity objects in Azure Active Directory.  These can be initiated manually in the user interface, integrated with on-premises human resources systems using HTTP Api and Service Bus messages.

In addition to reviewing access, the reviewer also has the ability to remove access for the object under review with all actions made by the reviewer tracked and able to be reviewed later.

## Lifecycle Management Policies
Define policies for users, applications, groups, and other identity objects in Azure Active Directory to ensure access is managed over time.
